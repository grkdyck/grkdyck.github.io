# WECS Monthly Newsletter - Creative Direction, Production, and Publication

## My Role: 
Since June 2024, I have been the Newsletter Director for the UVic Women in Engineering and Computer Science Society, otherwise known as WECS.

This repository showcases the work I have done in the designing and production of these monthly newsletters. Each issue highlights WECS hosted or sponsored events, community initiatives, student opportunities, academic resources, and the occasional stress-reducing themed puzzle. 

As Newsletter Director, I lead the full creative process from theme development and layout design to content curation, editing and publication, in accordance to WECS principles, values, and input from the team on related content. This work has taught me a lot about communication in STEM, and demonstrates my skills in visual communication, editorial writing, project coordination and outreach.

## Featured Issues:
### March 2025
This issue is one of my favourites. Showcasing the lightness of spring, this newsletter from March 2025 features colourful foliage, bright colours, a floral-themed word search puzzle and a secret four-leaf clover hidden amongst the design. 
<b>Theme:</b> "Spring has Sprung!" - Florals, foliage, and all sorts of springtime insects. This theme was chosen as an introduction to better weather after a dark winter, and as an ode to the colourful life of the blooming UVic campus. It features a large varieties of bright and pastel colours, chosen specifically to invoke the wide variety of flowers popping up across the UVic campus in the spring. 
<b>Fonts:</b> "Playpen Sans" for Headings and "Sunday" for the signature bold "WECS" on the cover.
<b>Cover Concept:</b> Each cover features the "WECS Scoop", an ice cream scoop customized to reflect the theme of the month. For this month, it was filled by flowers, grass and clovers. Essentially, it was a scoop full of springtime.
