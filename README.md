## Featured Issues:
### March 2025
This issue is one of my favourites. Showcasing the lightness of spring, this newsletter from March 2025 features colourful foliage, bright colours, a floral-themed word search puzzle and a secret four-leaf clover hidden amongst the design. 
<b>Theme:</b> "Spring has Sprung!" - Florals, foliage, and all sorts of springtime insects. This theme was chosen as an introduction to better weather after a dark winter, and as an ode to the colourful life of the blooming UVic campus. It features a large variety of bright and pastel colours, chosen specifically to invoke the wide variety of flowers popping up across the UVic campus in the spring. 
<b>Fonts:</b> "Playpen Sans" for Headings and "Sunday" for the signature bold "WECS" on the cover.
<b>Cover Concept:</b> Each cover features the "WECS Scoop", an ice cream scoop customized to reflect the theme of the month. For this month, it was filled with flowers, grass and clovers. Essentially, it was a scoop full of springtime. 
#### Highlights:
<ul>
  <li> Custom spring-themed graphics, and curated colour palettes. </li>
  <li> Spotlight on open positions within WECS.</li>
  <li> Engaging opening and closing paragraphs, each with springtime elements.  </li>
  <li> Custom focus-engaging aspects, such as the floral word search and the hidden "lucky" clover. </li>
</ul>
## November 2025
A recent favourite, the November 2025 issue was the most graphic-heavy newsletter to date, and it was my first foray into using a custom background in Mailchimp. After a bit of toggling, the siding effect brought this edition to life, especially when compared to the colour-matching section dividers, headers, and the cover page. For this newsletter, I took direct peer feedback regarding aspects of the design, such as the background image, and the outline effect on the headers. 
<b>Theme:</b> "A Calm and Warm Fall" - Using warm hues such as brown and orange, my goal for this edition was for it to feel warm, almost like a cup of hot chocolate on a crisp day. 
<b>Fonts:</b> "Alex Brush" for the cover calligraphy and "Bugaki" for the signature bold "WECS" on the cover and the headers. Lato is chosen, as with all editions, for body text as it is clear and easier to read on mobile devices. 
<b>Cover Concept:</b> This month's scoop was filled with seasonal gourds, flowers, fallen leaves (in colours chosen to be similar to those you would find falling on the UVic campus), and a poppy as a nod to the Remembrance Day holiday. 
#### Highlights:
<ul>
  <li> Specially curated colour scheme and graphics that tie in well with the theme. </li>
  <li> Spotlight on WECS community, academic, and fundraising events.</li>
  <li> Engaging text highlighting recent events, especially those geared towards career success in Engineering and Computer Science. </li>
</ul>

## Design and Production: 
### 1. Theme and Content:
Throughout the month before a newsletter's publication, I mentally tally upcoming holidays, seasonal changes, campus initiatives, and WECS hosted events to pick a relevent theme. Sometimes, this theme blends multiple of these focuses, such as how the September 2025 edition's cover includes subtle nods to the WECS bracelet making event designed to foster connection within the faculty, while also tying in the seasonal "Back to School" theme. Other times, this theme is clear from the initial production of the newsletter. This can be seen in special editions such as the Review Sessions and Events newsletter published in December 2024. This newsletter was designed to effectively convey the lineup of WECS-run final exam review sessions for the semester, and as such had a fitting theme - academics, with the WECS signature colours. 

### 2. Layout Planning:
The newsletters follow a layout I have refined in a way as to catch the eye of the reader, and convey the most important matters first. This layout usually follows this order: 
a) Cover page including opening paragraph with a lead-in to content. 
b) Recent updates, featuring social media information, summaries of recent events, and calls to action for marketing endeavours such as merchandise sales. 
c) Upcoming events, which includes WECS sponsored or hosted events in the upcoming month and their details, such as sign-up links, dates, times and availability. 
d) Open postions. This section is reserved for open positions within the WECS executive team and general organization, as well as a call for volunteers for upcoming review sessions. Each position blurb features links to documents with more information, and instructions on how to apply. 
e) Any extra initiative or scholarship information, events passed along by partner organizations such as the UVic Engineering and Computer Science Students Society, or any fun custom activities I have built in like the word search in the March 2025 newsletter. 
f) Closing blurb or statement, usually in an eye-catching font that matches the cover page. 

### 3. Design:
When it comes to choosing design elements that match the theme, including colour palettes and fonts, I lead with accesibility in mind. All colours are chosen with regard to their boldness on the page, and all fonts chosen for readability on mobile devices. For body text, I maintain the use of Lato within newsletters as it is clear and amply spaced. This choice promotes easier readabilty for those with visual impairments. As for colouring, I choose darker colours for text, which allows for clarity and an eye-catching header. Colour palettes are a big part of the newsletter and I try to ensure that they are thematic while not obstructing focus or impacting readability. Accessibilty is a principle of WECS, and a personal principle of mine, so with each newsletter, I strive to find new ways to increase its accessibility for all members of our community. The newsletter is made for all. 

When it comes to graphics, I design all visual assets, illustrations and section separators within Canva, and occasionally use hand-drawing software to incorporate my own illustrations. I take great pride in making all illustrations fun and visually appealing, while still maintaining the principles and core values of the WECS organization. 

### 4. Content Curation:
Each month, I gather announcements, media requests, opportunities, event resources, and any other information that may be appropriate for the monthly newsletter. From here, I curate the wording and structure of each section. This part of the process relies heavily on the amazing WECS team, as their content requests, social media posts, website curation, and overall organization lend a great hand to my ability to gather this information. 

### 5. Editing and Accessibilty Checks:
Before each new edition is sent-out, I send a test email to myself and a peer reviewer, who each take the time to read through the content, catching any mistakes, as well as to go over the readability on multiple types of devices, the design, spacing consistency and alignment. This part of the process is crucial in ensuring that the sent-out newsletter is clean, clear and polished. 

### 6. Publishing and Distribution:
For the layout and distribution of the newsletter, we use MailChimp, which allows us to send the finished product out to a mailing list with customized titles, subjects, in-browser links, and previews.

## Reflection:
Creating the WECS newsletter has strengthened my ability to successfully communicate both technical and academic content in a clear, engaging way that incorporates organizational values with personal touches. It has also helped me develop project coordination skills, editorial judgement, and design thinking skills that I have been able to translate directly into technical documentation and communication in mathematical and computer science environments.
